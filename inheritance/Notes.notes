#Notes To avoid in Overloading and overriding

#1 . Avoid using Final and Static keywords.
#2 . Avoid Changing the acces modifiers.
#3 . Donâ€™t overload operators like +, - , * / etc., unless necessary
#4 . If you are going to override a method from super class then make sure that your code is not dependent on the specific behavior of this method
(and even then it is not always recommended).
#5 . Avoid Changing parameters of methods in overriding this will lead to overridding instead.
